# FriendFinder
The FriendFinder is a fictitious startup app. It is a Human-Dog Dating app that matches shelter's dog with lonely human. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the shelters's dog with the best overall match.
